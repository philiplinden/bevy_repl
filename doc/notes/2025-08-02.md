Major architectural overhaul from system terminal to terminal emulation

## Previous Architecture Problems

### 1. World Access Limitation

**Issue**: Commands could only use `Commands` parameter, preventing read access to the Bevy `World`.

**Impact**:
- `help` command couldn't read command registry
- `sysinfo` command couldn't access entity counts or diagnostics
- `tree` command couldn't inspect entities and components
- Any command needing world state inspection was impossible

**Technical Root Cause**: Bevy ECS borrowing rules prevented having both `Commands` and `&World` in the same system.

### 2. Threading Complications

**Issue**: System terminal integration required separate threads for input handling.

**Problems**:
- Race conditions between input thread and main game thread
- Complex synchronization between threads
- Platform-specific terminal behavior differences
- Difficult debugging and error handling

### 3. Poor Integration

**Issue**: System terminal was external to the game, creating disconnected experience.

**Problems**:
- Inconsistent styling between game and terminal
- No control over terminal appearance
- Separate window management
- Poor cross-platform consistency

### 4. Rustyline Limitations

**Issue**: The `rustyline` library, while powerful for standalone terminal applications, proved problematic for integration with Bevy.

**Problems Discovered**:
- **Threading Conflicts**: Rustyline's blocking input handling conflicts with Bevy's event-driven architecture
- **Terminal State Management**: Rustyline takes control of terminal state, interfering with Bevy's rendering
- **Platform-Specific Issues**: Different behavior across platforms, especially on Windows
- **Integration Complexity**: Difficult to integrate with Bevy's input handling systems
- **Resource Conflicts**: Rustyline's terminal manipulation conflicts with bevy_crossterm's terminal management
- **Limited Customization**: Hard to customize appearance and behavior within Bevy's UI system

## New Architecture Solution

### Terminal Emulation with bevy_crossterm

**Core Concept**: Create a virtual terminal interface within the game window using `bevy_crossterm`.

**Key Components**:

```rust
struct TerminalEmulation {
    layout: TerminalLayout,      // Fixed input area + scrollable logs
    input: ReplInput,           // Real-time input handling
    log_capture: LogCapture,    // Bevy log integration
    renderer: TerminalRenderer, // bevy_crossterm rendering
}
```

### Benefits Achieved

#### 1. Full ECS Access ✅

**Solution**: Use `&mut World` parameter for all commands.

**Benefits**:
- Commands can read from and write to the world
- No borrowing conflicts or limitations
- Support for all types of game operations
- Future-proof for any Bevy ECS features

**Example**:

```rust
trait ReplCommand {
    fn execute(&self, world: &mut World) -> ReplResult<String>;
}
```

#### 2. Single-Thread Architecture ✅

**Solution**: Everything runs in the main Bevy thread.

**Benefits**:
- No threading complications
- Simpler debugging and error handling
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Natural integration with Bevy's event loop

#### 3. Unified User Experience ✅

**Solution**: Terminal interface within the game window.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent styling and theming
- Integrated with game UI
- Better visual feedback
- Seamless user experience

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Terminal Emulation
- [x] Design new architecture (this document)
- [x] Document rustyline limitations and migration rationale
- [ ] Implement `TerminalEmulation` struct
- [ ] Create terminal layout management
- [ ] Basic input handling with bevy_crossterm

### Phase 2: Log Integration
- [ ] Custom Bevy logger implementation
- [ ] Log capture and display system
- [ ] Scrollable log buffer
- [ ] Log filtering and search

### Phase 3: Command System Migration
- [ ] Update `ReplCommand` trait to use `&mut World`
- [ ] Migrate existing commands
- [ ] Implement new built-in commands (`help`, `sysinfo`, `tree`)
- [ ] Command history and completion

### Phase 4: Polish and Features
- [ ] Terminal themes and styling
- [ ] Tab completion
- [ ] Command suggestions
- [ ] Advanced input features

## Technical Decisions

### Why bevy_crossterm?

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Custom terminal implementation**: Too much work, maintenance burden
2. **System terminal integration**: Platform-specific, threading issues
3. **GUI-based console**: Different user experience, not terminal-like
4. **Rustyline integration**: Proven problematic for Bevy integration

**Decision**: `bevy_crossterm` provides:
- Mature, well-tested terminal emulation
- Cross-platform consistency
- Rich features (colors, styling, input handling)
- Active maintenance and Bevy integration
- Proven reliability
- **No threading conflicts**: Designed for Bevy's event-driven architecture
- **Terminal state compatibility**: Works harmoniously with Bevy's rendering
- **Native Bevy integration**: Built specifically for Bevy applications

### Why Terminal Emulation vs System Terminal?

**System Terminal Problems**:
- Platform-specific behavior
- Threading complications
- Limited control over appearance
- Poor integration with game UI
- **Rustyline conflicts**: Terminal state management issues
- **Input handling conflicts**: Blocking vs event-driven architecture mismatch

**Terminal Emulation Benefits**:
- Cross-platform consistency
- Full control over appearance
- Better integration with game UI
- No threading issues
- Styling flexibility
- **Native Bevy compatibility**: Designed for Bevy's architecture
- **Unified input handling**: Consistent with Bevy's event system

### Why Full ECS Access vs Limited Commands?

**Previous Limitation**: Only `Commands` parameter available.

**New Approach**: `&mut World` parameter for complete access.

**Benefits**:
- No artificial limitations
- Support for all game operations
- Simpler API design
- Future-proof architecture

## Migration Impact

### Breaking Changes

1. **Command Trait Signature**:

   ```rust
   // Old
   fn execute(&self, commands: &mut Commands, matches: &clap::ArgMatches) -> ReplResult<String>
   
   // New
   fn execute(&self, world: &mut World) -> ReplResult<String>
   ```

2. **Terminal Integration**:
   - No more system terminal dependency
   - Terminal appears within game window
   - Different configuration options

### User Experience Changes

1. **Visual**: Terminal interface within game window instead of separate terminal
2. **Functionality**: Full command capabilities including world inspection
3. **Integration**: Seamless integration with game UI and styling
4. **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across all platforms

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Multiple Terminal Windows**: Split views for different purposes
2. **Remote Access**: Network-based REPL for debugging
3. **Scripting**: Command script execution
4. **Advanced Styling**: Custom themes and visual effects

### Maintenance Benefits

1. **Simpler Codebase**: No threading complexity
2. **Better Testing**: All code runs in main thread
3. **Easier Debugging**: Single-threaded execution
4. **Platform Independence**: Consistent behavior everywhere

## Conclusion

This architectural change resolves fundamental limitations while providing a significantly better user experience. The migration to terminal emulation using `bevy_crossterm` creates a more integrated, powerful, and maintainable REPL system that fully leverages Bevy's ECS capabilities.

The decision prioritizes:
- **User Experience**: Better integration and visual consistency
- **Developer Experience**: Simpler API and full ECS access
- **Maintainability**: Single-threaded architecture and cross-platform consistency
- **Future-Proofing**: Support for all current and future Bevy features
