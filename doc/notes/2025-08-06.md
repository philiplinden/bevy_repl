# Summary of 2025-08-06 Changes

## Conclusions and Actions
- Added REPL prompt system to the Bevy application.
- Implemented input capture, buffer management, and prompt display at the terminal bottom.
- Introduced event blocking to prevent game input when REPL is active.

## Key Evidence
- `PromptPlugin` struct and plugin implementation added.
- New resources and events: `ReplPrompt`, `ReplBufferEvent`, `ReplSubmitEvent`.
- Systems for input capture (`capture_repl_input`), buffer update, prompt display (`display_prompt`), and event blocking (`block_event_forwarding`).

## Details
- The REPL prompt is customizable and can display a border.
- Input events are processed and mapped to buffer actions (insert, delete, move, submit).
- The prompt and buffer are rendered at the bottom of the terminal, with cursor positioning.
- When REPL is enabled, most key events are blocked from reaching the rest of the game, except for the toggle key.
- Design follows Bevy's ECS and event-driven patterns, ensuring modularity and extensibility.
